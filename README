Introduction
------------

mod_savi integrates the Sophos antivirus scanning engine into the Apache
web server. This allows files delivered by the web server to be scanned
for viruses in real time.

mod_savi came about as part of a mail gateway virus scanning
implementation. We had chosen amavis as the integration glue between our
MTA and the virus scanner. Unfortunately, amavis spawned a new
virus-scanning process for every mail message. Clearly, this is extremely
inefficient and undesirable, particularly under heavy load.

Preferably, a virus-scanning engine could remain resident and be called as
necessary. While some projects along these lines already existed, none was
quite what I was looking for.

Ideally, such an implementation should be:

     * robust/reliable
     * portable
     * secure
     * scalable
     * fast
     * load-adjusting within resource limits


From an abstract point of view, it seemed the Apache web server satisfied
all of these criteria. It is well-tuned and highly reliable. It undergoes
considerable auditing and has been ported to many platforms. It is
designed to service many requests efficiently, and automatically grows or
shrinks according to load, but has the ability to specify hard limits to
prevent resource exhaustion. Plus, it has a modular API that allows
flexible extensions. Rather than trying to reinvent a wheel, it seemed
that integrating virus scanning into Apache would solve the problem
elegantly.
     
At this point, all the module does if virus scanning is enabled is return
an X-SAVI-Status header containing one of the following values:

     clean
     infected[;<virus_name>]+
     error;<message>


By setting the web server document root to the location of the files to
be virus-scanned and issuing a HEAD request for a given file, a client
can quickly and efficiently determine whether it contains a virus.

While the current implementation is intended mainly for use in a mail
gateway virus-scanning configuration, it could easily be extended to
perform more general web/virus-related tasks. Possible extensions of
this module could include refusal to deliver a virus-infected file,
automatic cleaning of files as they are delivered, or scanning of uploaded
files.


Installation
------------

In order to successfully compile and use mod_savi, you must have already
acquired and installed the Sophos Anti-Virus software and API. Information
about these products can be found at

     http://www.sophos.com/products/software/


Move the savi subdirectory of the mod_savi distribution to the
apache/src/modules directory. For example:

     cd /path/to/mod_savi
     tar cf - savi | (cd /path/to/apache/src/modules && tar xf -)


If you are using the Apache Autoconf-style Interface (APACI), supply the
option '--activate-module=src/modules/savi/mod_savi.c' to configure.
Otherwise, edit the Configuration file and add the line

     AddModule modules/savi/mod_savi.o


Configure and compile Apache.


Configuration Directives
------------------------

  Directive                  Context         Default Value
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  SaviEnable                 directory       Off

    This directive enables or disables virus scanning for requests
    in the specified directory or location.

  Directive                  Context         Default Value
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  SaviIDELocation            server          -none-

    This directive specifies the location for the Sophos virus
    definition files. The location can also be specified by setting
    the SAV_IDE environment variable before starting the web server.


  Directive                  Context         Default Value
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  SaviTmpDir                 server          -none-

    This directive specifies the location for temporary files
    during virus scanning. The location can also be specified by
    setting the SAV_TMP environment variable before starting the
    web server.


  The following directives correspond to Sophos virus-scanning
  options. Please see the appropriate Sophos documentation for
  a full description of the options.

    A sample Apache configuration file utilizing mod_savi
    to perform virus scanning with amavis. It runs the web server
    on the loopback interface port 8080 with the document root
    set to the amavis temporary directory.

    A simple example showing how to request a virus scan through
    the web server and obtain the results.

  example/sophos

    A replacement for the bundled sophos integration code in
    amavis to utilize a mod_savi-enabled web server for virus
    scanning. This is based on amavis-perl-11. We haven't tried
    amavisd yet, but this code should serve as a suitable example
    for anyone interested in trying mod_savi with that version.

  example/sophos_update.pl

    A simple script to update Sophos virus definitions. When
    executed with the -m option, it will download and install
    the latest full version of the Sophos virus scanner. When
    executed with no options, it will download and install the
    latest available IDEs.
